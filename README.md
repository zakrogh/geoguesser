# _GeoGuesser_

#### _A JavaScript recreation of the game geoguessr using the Google Maps API 9/12/2019_

#### By _Zach Krogh_

## Description

_This game shows the user a map of Seattle and a google maps street view map of a specific location in Seattle. The user must then guess where they are by clicking on the map and pressing the "Make a Guess" button. Then a score is displayed based on how close to the original location their guess was._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Install node package manager_
* _Download all files into the same directory and run "npm install" in the terminal from the project directory_
* _Then run "npm run build" in the terminal from the project directory_
* _Open the index.html file in the "dist" directory_
* _Alternatively, run "npm run start" instead of "npm run build" and a browser window will open_
* _Note: While the program will function correctly without an api key, both the map and the street view map will display developer versions unless you input your own api key in the index.html file after " https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key= "_
